# Netflix-Clone

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Modules Used
- React
- React-dom
- Axios
- React-youtube
- Movie-trailer

## What did I learn?
- To use react functional components.
- How to use built in react hooks useState and useEffect.
  - useState allows you to add state to your functional components.Using the useState hook inside a function component, you can create a piece of state without     switching to class components.
  - useEffect is the combination of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount class lifecycle methods.It is ideal place to set up listeners, fetching data from API and removing listeners before the component is removed from the DOM.
- Use axios to perform network requests.
- To use movie-trailer to fetch movie trailers from youtube.
- To use react-youtube to display the trailer
